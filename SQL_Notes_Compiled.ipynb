    "### 1. The OVER Clause\n",
    "Every window function needs an OVER clause. It defines the “window” — the set of rows over which the function operates.\n",

    "What is a Subquery? \n",
    "Used when a query needs the result of another query. A subquery is a SELECT statement inside:\n",
    "1. WHERE\n",
    "2. SELECT (E.g: SELECT EmpID, Salary, (SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employees) AS AvgCompanySalary FROM Employees)\n",
    "3. FROM\n",
    "4. HAVING\n",
    "5. INSERT / UPDATE\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Single‑Row Subqueries\n",
    "These return one row, one value.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multi‑Row Subqueries\n",
    "Return multiple rows.\n",
    "Used with:\n",
    "IN, NOT IN  (SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE DeptID IN (SELECT DeptID FROM Departments WHERE Location = 'Delhi')) \n",
    "ANY (SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Salary > ANY (SELECT Salary FROM Interns)) # Finds salary > minimum intern salary.\n",
    "ALL (SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Salary > ANY (SELECT Salary FROM Interns)) # Finds salary > highest intern salary.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: SQL SERVER suports both SOME and ANY which are synonyms. They return TRUE if the comparison is satisfied for at least one value in the set. They differ from ALL, which requires the condition to be true for every value in the set\n",

    "E.g - Are there any customers that never ordered\n",
    "SELECT CustomerKey\n",
    "FROM DimCustomer\n",
    "WHERE customerkey NOT IN (SELECT CustomerKey FROM FactInternetSales)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Subqueries Using Built‑in Functions\n",
    "Helpful when using:COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX\n",
    "E.g: WHERE Salary > (SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employee)\n",

    "## Nested SubQueries\n",
    "E.g - Find All employees having salaries > average of IT department employee salaries.\n",

    "## Correlated Subqueries\n",

    "✔ Subquery runs once per row of outer query\n",
    "✔ Slower but extremely powerful\n",
    "✔ Often replaced by window functions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Derived Tables (Subqueries in FROM)\n",
    "A subquery acting like a temporary table.\n",
    "E.g:\n",
    "SELECT DeptID, AvgSal\n",

    "     SELECT DeptID, AVG(Salary) AS AvgSal\n",
    "     FROM Employees\n",

    "## Common Table Expressions (CTEs)\n",
    "A CTE is a named derived table that is readable and reusable.\n",
    "Why CTE is preferred over derived tables?\n",

    "## Dynamic SQL\n",

    "DECLARE @sql NVARCHAR(MAX)\n",
    "SET @sql = 'SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE DeptID = 5'\n",
    "EXEC(@sql)\n",
    "\n",
    "Used when:\n",
    "✔ Table name is dynamic\n",

    "What Is an Index?\n",
    "An index in SQL is like the index of a book — it helps the database find data faster without scanning the entire table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without index → SQL must read every row → full table scan\n",
    "With index → SQL jumps straight to the matching rows → index seek\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "QUESTION : On which columns shall we create indexes? \n",
    "Indexes are generally created on columns most frequently searched for. We can create a separate index on each column but that would \n",
    "take extra storage and slows down INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE operations which wont be an optmised way. \n",
    "Therefore it is recommended to only create indexes on columns most frequently searched for. \n",
    "Indexes are typically created on:\n",
    "1. Columns used frequently in WHERE clauses\n",
    "2. Columns used for JOINs\n",
    "3. Columns used for ORDER BY / GROUP BY\n",
    "4. High selectivity columns (many unique values)\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid indexing:\n",
    "1. Low-selectivity columns like Address, Gender, IsActive\n",
    "2. Columns rarely used in searches\n",
    "3. Very large VARCHAR columns unless necessary\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "QUESTION : What is PK?\n",
    "A primary key is a column or a set of columns in a database table that uniquely identifies each record. \n",
    "It ensures that no two rows have the same value for the primary key and that the value is never NULL. \n",
    "Every table can have only one primary key, but it can consist of multiple columns (known as a composite key).\n",
    "Key characteristics of a primary key:\n",
    "1. Uniqueness: Each value must be unique across all rows.\n",
    "2. Non-nullable: Cannot contain NULL values.\n",
    "3. Minimal: Uses the smallest number of columns necessary to ensure uniqueness.\n",
    "4. Time-invariant: Values should not change over the lifetime of the record.\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "QUESTION : why use UNIQUE separately if PK already enforces uniqueness?\n",
    "PRIMARY KEY Purpose  = main identifier. Used for foreign keys.\n",
    "UNIQUE Purpose = additional business rules but this is not the main identifier. Also, it allows NUll (1 NULL allowed). Multiple columns can have this constraint."
